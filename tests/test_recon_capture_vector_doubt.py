"""Vector-doubt reflex: two mechanical tells that the CURRENT exploit vector is wrong, so the
operator reconsiders the VECTOR instead of tuning the tooling.

(a) target starved -- an exploit-shaped loop draws repeated 000 / connection-timeout / empty-reply
    responses = the box is being DoS'd by our own load (almost never the intended vector on a lab
    box); (b) uncrackable hashes -- >=2 '0 password hashes cracked' results in one engagement =
    the passwords are not wordlist material (delivered out-of-band: email/notes/KeePass), so stop
    cracking and re-enumerate. Recurring drift: a fragile-box SQLi hash-dump-and-crack grind that
    was a rabbit hole while the real foothold was an unenumerated file-read/LFI class.
