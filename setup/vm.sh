# vm.sh - one-line SSH bridge to the Kali attack VM. Device-local. No secrets in this file.
#
# Reads IP(s)/user/password from ~/.torch/creds.txt (git-ignored, per-device) and runs a
# command as the configured user on the VM, streaming output back. Cross-machine: it tries
# each candidate host in priority order (Tailscale/100.x IP first = location-independent,
# then the LAN/VM IP) and uses the first that answers on :22. So the SAME script works from
# any machine that can reach the VM by any of those addresses.
#
#   bash ~/.torch/vm.sh '<remote bash command>'
#   bash ~/.torch/vm.sh 'id; hostname; ip -4 addr'
#
# creds.txt is parsed flexibly - both label form and header form are accepted:
#   kali ip: 192.168.23.128        |   # IP
#   tailnet ip: 100.x.y.z          |   192.168.23.128
#   username: kali                 |   # Username
#   password: secret               |   kali
# Add a "tailnet ip:" line to make it reach the VM from off-LAN machines (needs Tailscale
# on this host + the VM on the same tailnet).
#
# Gotchas (see docs/virtual-machine.md): no stdin forwarding (base64 files INTO the command);
# no persistent state (chain with ; / &&); fails fast on unreachable (ConnectTimeout).
