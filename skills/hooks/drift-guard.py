"""PreToolUse(Bash) hook: nudge the campaign driver back into view (anti-drift, advisory-only).

The proven failure: the deterministic driver (scripts/campaign.py) is advisory BY
INVOCATION - it only enforces its gates on turns the agent chooses to run it, so under
momentum the agent walked away from `campaign.py next` in 90 seconds and free-handed a whole
box via 85 raw `bash ~/.torch/vm.sh` exploit calls. This hook pulls the agent back: on an
exploit-shaped Bash command during an active campaign, if the agent is OFF-BOARD (running an
exploit/scan binary the driver never emitted, and the board is NOT empty), it ESCALATES a
counter and ADVISES the agent back to the driver. It never denies a command - the standing
operator complaint was that a hard deny throttles legit engagements, so this hook is advisory
only (the RTL reflex now lives in campaign.py's `_tells_stop` + recon-capture's vector-doubt
nudges).

Policy:
  - off_board_streak N -> INJECT an advisory warning ("run campaign.py next; N calls since"),
    for every N (the counter is kept and reported, but never escalates to a deny)
  - `campaign.py next|board|done|pass-done|init` seen in the command -> reset the streak to 0

ON-BOARD (allowed, never counted) when EITHER:
  - the command's exploit/scan binary is in .campaign.json emitted_bins (the driver told them to
    run it), OR
  - the board is empty/uncounted (generic tech -> playbook+behaviours yield 0 rows -> the driver
    has nothing to serve, so there is nothing to hold the agent to). Fail-open by design.

EXPLOIT-SHAPED = handroll.classify() fires (a substitutable hand-rolled request loop) OR the
command mentions a network/scan/exploit binary (NET_BINS). NET_BINS is word-searched over the
WHOLE command string, not just the leading token, so `bash ~/.torch/vm.sh 'nmap ...'` - the exact
wrapper the reference failure used - is caught by the inner binary.

SAFETY (this hook only advises, but stays fail-open anyway - never let a hook bug break a turn):
  - Fail-OPEN everywhere: no engagement / no .campaign.json / pass < 5 / unparseable / any
    exception -> exit 0, allow. A hook bug never blocks a command.
  - pass >= 5 gate: only fires once the board is actually driving (passes 0-4 are pre-board recon
    where free exploration is expected).
