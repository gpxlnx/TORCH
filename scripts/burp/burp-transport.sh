# burp-transport.sh -- resolve which Burp MCP transport the skill should drive.
# Prints ONE word on stdout (native|bridge|down); all guidance goes to stderr.
#
# WHY: the native mcp__burp__* tools only attach at SESSION START (if the Kali VM
# was up then) and never auto-reconnect. When they are absent the model cannot tell
# "VM down" from "Burp closed"; this makes the fallback deterministic -- bridge if the
# SSH CLI answers, else down with the real recovery (restart the session, VM up first).
#
# The NATIVE check is a MODEL action (ToolSearch select:mcp__burp__...), not shell-
# reachable, so the skill exports BURP_NATIVE=1 when that search loaded the tools and
# this script honors it as the top branch. bridge/down it probes itself.
#
# Usage:
#   burp-transport.sh            # resolve + print the mode word (guidance on stderr)
#   burp-transport.sh --dry-run  # offline: never dial the bridge (native-or-down only)

burp-transport: Burp MCP unreachable (native tools absent AND the SSH bridge listed no tools).
Most likely the Kali VM was DOWN at session start, so the native mcp__burp__ server never attached
(it only connects at startup and does not auto-reconnect). Recovery:
  1) bring the VM up and start Burp with the MCP Server BApp (SSE on 127.0.0.1:9876), then
  2) RESTART this session so the native server re-attaches.
Use the bridge (scripts/burp/burp-mcp-cli.py) only if a session restart is unacceptable.
