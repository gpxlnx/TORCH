# Auto-card FINISHED scan tmux tabs for an engagement into recon/ - the always-on half of live
# capture. Run SYNCHRONOUSLY (bounded) from the Stop hook each turn: it renders any scan tab that has
# finished since last time and isn't carded yet. Bounded so it completes inside the hook window --
# a detached spawn was unreliable over the WSL/remote-VM SSH bridge (the grandchild often never ran,
# so cards only appeared in one late batch at close-out). Running it in-hook, capped to a couple of
# tabs per turn, makes cards trickle in live and deterministically.
#
#   bash scripts/autocard.sh <engagement>
#
# Env: AUTOCARD_MAX=N   cards at most N tabs per invocation (default 2, keeps a run short so it
#                       finishes well under the hook timeout; the rest are picked up next turn).
#      CAPTURE_SH=path  override the capture.sh used (test injection); default scripts/capture.sh.
#      VM_SH=path       the SSH bridge to the tooling VM (default ~/.torch/vm.sh).
# Idempotent: each tab is carded once (tracked in targets/<eng>/.carded-tabs). Fail-open: any
# problem (no VM, no tmux session, no tabs) exits 0 silently. A tab still running is skipped this
# round and picked up on a later turn once its pane shows the shell prompt again.
