# backup-sweep.sh -- find dev-leaked SOURCE backups that feroxbuster structurally cannot.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: feroxbuster's `-x bak` appends ONE extension to a base WORD (login -> login.bak),
# so it never requests login.php.bak -- a backup SUFFIX on a full filename. Source-leak backups are
# almost always `<realfile>.<suffix>` (login.php.bak, config.php~, db.php.old). This sweep appends
# backup suffixes to full web-source filenames (a common seed + any discovered files) and filters the
# soft-404 baseline (apps that 200 every path). A single .php.bak = the whole app's source + creds.
#
# Usage:
#   backup-sweep.sh <base-url> [discovered-paths-file]
#   CAIDO_PROXY=127.0.0.1:8080 backup-sweep.sh http://T/     # route via Caido so it lands in Proxy history
#   backup-sweep.sh --dry-run <base-url> [paths-file]        # print the URLs it would probe (offline check)
set -uo pipefail
DRY=0; [ "${1:-}" = "--dry-run" ] && { DRY=1; shift; }
URL="${1:?usage: backup-sweep.sh [--dry-run] <base-url> [discovered-paths-file]}"; URL="${URL%/}"
EXTRA="${2:-}"

# ONE curl invocation shared by the baseline and every probe.
#  -A browser UA + Accept-Language: a stock `curl/8.x` UA draws a blanket edge 403 on a WAF/CDN
#     -fronted estate, and every probe then comes back 403 -- indistinguishable from "no backups
#     here" in the old output. Same UA recon-web.sh sends its scanners for the same reason.
#  -k: a self-signed / mismatched origin cert otherwise fails every request as code 000.
#  --connect-timeout / --max-time: this loop is SERIAL over ~1200 probes, so one hung request used
#     to stall the whole sweep (the tab never finishes, nothing is ever reported).
