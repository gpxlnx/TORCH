# Run ONE command in an engagement's reverse-shell tmux tab and return its clean output.
#
# Fixes the recurring drift of hand-driving a reverse shell with `tmux send-keys` +
# `capture-pane` and losing turns to shell-quoting (base64 wrappers, nested quotes). The
# command is base64-wrapped (so ANY quoting/metachars survive the vm.sh -> ssh -> tmux
# bridge), run between unique markers in the shell tab, and only the output between the
# markers is returned.
#
# Usage: bash vm-rsh.sh [--win shell] [--timeout 40] <session> <command...>
#   bash vm-rsh.sh <eng> 'strings /srv/x | grep -i clearance'
#   bash vm-rsh.sh --win shell <eng> 'cat /root/root.txt'
#
# Assumes a reverse shell is already live in tmux window <session>:<win> (default 'shell',
# the window scripts/vm-scan.sh --win shell created for the nc listener). VM_SH overridable
# for tests. Fail-soft: prints nothing + exits 1 if the end marker never appears.

# Fixed markers: a real command will not emit these ALONE on a line; the extractor takes the
# LAST start-marker line and the first end-marker line after it, so a prior run's markers still
# in scrollback do not confuse it.
# ponytail: fixed markers (not per-run random) so the output is trivially testable; matching a
# marker only when it is ALONE on its line covers echo-on PTYs (the shell echoes the whole
# command line, markers embedded and narrow-wrapped) and scrollback collisions.
