# Vault Setup

**New machine:** run `bash setup/bootstrap.sh` from the vault root. This creates the `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` include, copies obsidian skills, installs bun + qmd, installs the four official Claude plugins (code-review, frontend-design, skill-creator, claude-md-management), installs caveman and ponytail, and registers the `wiki-search` and `caveman-shrink` MCP servers. After setup, restart Claude Code and run `qmd update` to build the local search index.

**Caveman (both machines):** Output compression skill -- cuts ~65% of Claude output tokens with no accuracy loss. Requires Node >=18. Bootstrap handles install automatically; to install manually: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman/main/install.sh | bash`. Trigger per session with `/caveman`, or say "talk like caveman". Source: https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman

**Ponytail (both machines):** "lazy senior dev" engineering-discipline plugin -- pushes for the simplest working solution (YAGNI, stdlib/native before dependencies, shortest diff). Governs what you build, not prose (pairs with caveman for terse output). Auto-activates at SessionStart (level `full`); switch with `/ponytail lite|full|ultra`. Install: `claude plugins marketplace add DietrichGebert/ponytail && claude plugins install ponytail@ponytail`. Source: https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail

**caveman-shrink MCP (both machines):** MCP proxy that wraps `wiki-search` (qmd.mcp_server) and compresses tool descriptions before Claude reads them, reducing context token usage. Bootstrap registers it automatically at user scope with the correct `QMD_VAULT` for each machine. To register manually: `claude mcp add caveman-shrink -s user -e QMD_VAULT=<vault-path> -- npx -y caveman-shrink qmd mcp`. Both `wiki-search` (raw) and `caveman-shrink` (compressed descriptions) run as separate MCP entries; they share the same underlying data.

**qmd / `wiki-search` index:** Aim the markdown collection (`wiki`, or whichever name your MCP uses) only at **`$(vault-root)/wiki`**. Set `QMD_VAULT` to your vault root (no trailing slash). Remove stale collections that still reference old absolute paths before `qmd update` so indexing never scans the wrong directory.

**Vault file reads:** Use the `Read` tool with the vault path directly. The `obsidian-vault` MCP (`mcp-obsidian`) was removed -- it required the Obsidian app running and offered no advantage over `Read`. See `skills/skills-setup.md` for details.

**Hook symlink (wiki session hooks):** `bootstrap.sh` creates this automatically. To create it manually:

```bash
VAULT="<vault-root>"   # e.g. /mnt/c/Users/<you>/Documents/ObsidianVaults/ClaudeBrain
ln -sf "$VAULT/skills/hooks" ~/.claude/vault-hooks
```

Then register the vault hook set in `~/.claude/settings.json` (`bash setup/install-hooks.sh` does this for you; the canonical set spans 6 events -- see below). On a new machine, re-running `bash setup/bootstrap.sh` handles both steps automatically.

## Engagement-state automation (both machines)

**Transport is Obsidian Sync** for everything: the markdown knowledge base AND the automation code (`.py`, `.json`, `.sh`). There is no git push; a local git repo may exist per-device as offline history only (Obsidian does not sync `.git`).

**Hard requirement:** Obsidian Sync must be set to carry non-markdown files, or the hook code never reaches the other device and automation is dead there. In Obsidian: **Settings -> Sync -> turn ON "Sync all other file types"**, and confirm **Selective Sync** is not excluding `skills/`, `scripts/`, or `setup/`. By default Obsidian also skips dotfiles, but nothing runtime-critical is a dotfile (the engagement pointer is `targets/active.md`, not `.active`), so that exclusion is harmless.

**Device-2 / new-device procedure:**

```bash
# 1. let Obsidian Sync finish pulling the vault (incl. skills/, scripts/, setup/)
# 2. then, once per device:
cd <vault-root>
bash setup/install-hooks.sh    # symlinks ~/.claude/vault-hooks + registers the vault hook set
# 3. restart Claude Code
```

`install-hooks.sh` is self-locating (works on any user/path/spelling) and idempotent. It registers the canonical set (mirrored in `scripts/check-hooks.py` `EXPECTED_HOOKS`; `engagement-init` warns at SessionStart if any is unregistered) -- 12 hook commands across 6 events:
- **SessionStart** -- `session-start.sh` (skill auto-register + hot.md cache), `engagement-init.py` (self-heals the per-type core set: ctf gets `state/loot/Approach/...`, pentest/bugbounty add `Killchain`; injects the state summary + plan board status + top next-moves + one compact `harness:` maintenance line).
- **UserPromptSubmit** -- `hunt-trigger.py` (fires hunt skills from `skills/hunt/triggers.json`).
- **PreToolUse (Bash)** -- `scope-guard.py` (ENFORCES: denies out-of-scope host/IP (IPv4+IPv6, CIDR-aware; query-param/fragment values exempt) or RoE-forbidden tooling; fail-open + `skills/hooks/.enforce-off` escape hatch; also logs each block as a drift signal).
- **PreToolUse (Write)** -- `session-guard.py` (client-marker leak guard: session/* AND git-tracked framework trees; targets/ + docs/superpowers/ exempt; logs a boundary-drift signal).
- **PreToolUse (Bash)** -- `drift-guard.py` (makes the campaign driver non-optional: on an off-board exploit-shaped command during an active campaign at pass>=5 -- a NET_BINS/handroll call whose binary the driver never emitted, board non-empty -- escalates an `off_board_streak` in `.campaign.json`: 1-2 injects a "run campaign.py next" warning, >=3 DENIES; a `campaign.py next|board|done` call resets it. Fail-open; shares the `.enforce-off` escape hatch).
- **PostToolUse (Bash)** -- `recon-capture.py` (fingerprint router + OOB callback correlation + a once-per-engagement GATE-1 wiki-first nudge; a framework-meta guard suppresses false fires; advisory).
- **PostToolUse (all)** -- `tool-telemetry.py` (per-box telemetry: appends every tool/skill call to `targets/<eng>/.events.jsonl`, stamps `started_at`, records the session `transcript_path`; feeds `scripts/eval_metrics.py`. Silent, fail-open).
- **PostToolUse (Write/Edit)** -- `wiki-reindex.py` (auto-reindex: a Write/Edit to `wiki/**/*.md` fires a debounced background `qmd update` so the change is searchable without a manual reindex; off the blocking path, fail-open).
- **PreCompact** -- `pre-compact.sh` (persist state before compaction).
- **Stop** -- `close-out.py` (close-out reflex: when the engagement is SOLVED but its walkthrough is unassembled / the learn harvest is due, nudges Skill(walkthrough) then Skill(learn); advisory, self-clearing).

**Hooks self-locate the vault** via `realpath(__file__)` through the `~/.claude/vault-hooks` symlink -- no hardcoded paths, so the same code runs unmodified on every device.

**Active engagement pointer:** `targets/active.md` (one line: engagement dir name). It is markdown, so it syncs via Obsidian to both devices. Engagement files: `targets/<eng>/{state,loot,Approach,scope,Deadends}.md` + `ingest/` for ctf; pentest/bugbounty add `Killchain,log,walkthrough,eval`. Scaffolded from `setup/templates/<type>/` via `bash setup/new-engagement.sh <name> <pentest|bugbounty|ctf>`.

**`settings.json` and the symlink never sync** (machine-local by design). Always run `install-hooks.sh` once per device after the first git pull.

## Caido on Kali

Run Caido as the Kali graphical seat user so proxy and Replay traffic use the VM's
VPN and target routes. Keep its API bound to `127.0.0.1:8080`; reach it from the
Debian host through an SSH local-forward. Create the PAT on Kali, configure the SDK
fallback on Debian, and restart Claude after enabling the native Caido MCP because
MCP tools attach at session start.

The full setup lives in `setup/caido/README.md` and `wiki/tools/caido.md`. Driver
scripts are under `scripts/caido/`; skills are `hunt-caido` and `screenshot-caido`.
Caido evidence capture reads a stored request ID and does not depend on GUI input or
an unlocked desktop.
